## Intro

This is a tech test for which I had to modify an existing index.html file to allow for filtering of candidates by skill.

* To see the result, open index.html file in your browser.
* I've added a test for the code I've modified. Open SpecRunner.html in your browser to see the test result.

## My approach

- I first modified the filterCandidateBySkill method to work. I added a test for this method using Jasmine.
- I broke code up into sections to observe separation of concerns.
- I added filtering to the page using jquery. To reset the table, the user can simply hit Submit when the filter is empty.
- I extended the styling to give the page a tidy, uniform look.
